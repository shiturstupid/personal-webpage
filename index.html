        <p>Hi! i am Zoha Azizi and this is going to be my first ever designed webpage!</p>
        <p> i was born in Mazar-E-Sharif in Afghanistan however i grew up in pakistan
            and i moved back to Afghanistan with my family sice i was 11 and am still 
            living in the beautiful city of Kabul!  </p>
        <p>last year around this time i found a very strong interest in coding and tech world in general but i could totally 
            see it coming because of my already deep love for maths and science subjects
            in school and since then ive been completely invested in it and i hope to learn more each day</p>
